 <b>Topic modeling is your turf too.</b> <br> <i> Contextual topic models with representations from transformers. </i></p>

### Intentions:
 - Provide simple, robust and fast implementations of existing approaches (BERTopic, Top2Vec, CTM) with minimal dependencies.
 - Implement state-of-the-art approaches from my papers. (papers work-in-progress)
 - Put all approaches in a broader conceptual framework.
 - Provide clear and extensive documentation about the best use-cases for each model.
 - Make the models' API streamlined and compatible with topicwizard and scikit-learn.
 - Develop smarter, transformer-based evaluation metrics.

(Stay tuned...)
